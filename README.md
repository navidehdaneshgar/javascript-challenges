 My solutions to JavaScript algorithmic challenges to improve problem-solving skills
This repository contains my solutions to various algorithmic challenges. I created this to practice logic, master JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+), and improve my problem-solving skills.

List of Challenges Solved:

1.  **Sum of Positives:** Filtering arrays and reducing values.
2.  **Reverse String:** String manipulation methods.
3.  **Remove Every Other:** Working with array indexes.
4.  **Multiplication Table:** Loops and template literals.
5.  **Period Is Late:** Working with `Date` objects.
6.  **Final Grade:** Conditional logic (`if/else`) and comparison operators.

 Skills Practiced:
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Array & String Methods
- Loops & Logic
- Debugging
